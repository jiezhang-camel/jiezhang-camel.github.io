This course is related to architecture fundamentals. Students are expected to be familiar with some hardware and computer science background. In this course, we provide two or three simple projects, one of each leveraging a different style of simulation models built for an educational purpose. The one of the goal behind these projects is that students can learn i) how to use full system simulation software and ii) how to perform simulation-based architectural studies, which in turn can be a good steppingstone for your future research. The simulation framework built on both most 32-bit and 64-bit flavors of UNIX and Windows NT-based operating systems. Although the projects will be relatively simple (compared to what an advanced computer architecture course usually deals with), we expect these projects can aid the students of the capability of freely analyzing/modifying C/C++ written software models.
