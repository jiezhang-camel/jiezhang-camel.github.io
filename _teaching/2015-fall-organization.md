Even though the class topics are related to architecture fundamentals, students are expect to have some hardware and computer science background. This course will include two or three simple projects, one of each leveraging a different style of simulation models build for an educational purpose. The one of the goal behind these projects is that students can learn i) how to use full system simulation software and ii) how to perform simulation-based architectural studies, which in turn can be a good steppingstone for your future research. The simulation framework built on both most 32-bit and 64-bit flavors of UNIX and Windows NT-based operating systems, but we recommend to modify them on a UNIX-like system. The projects will be relatively simple (compared to what an advanced computer architecture course usually deals with), but students should be capable of freely analyzing/modifying C/C++ written software models.
