The purpose of this course is to teach the general concepts and principles behind operating systems. The topic we have covered through this class, including i) kernel and process abstractions and programming, ii) scheduling and synchronization, iii) memory management and address translation, iv) caching and virtual memory v) file systems, storage devices, files and reliability, vi) full and para-virtualization. In addition to these lectures, we also provided term projects, which use an operating system simulator/emulator built for an educational purpose. In these projects, we expect that the students not only can learn Linux practices but also make great strides in studies on operating systems design and implementation. This is in C/C++, rather than Java or Python. We believe that these projects can provide a more realistic experience in operating systems to students. In this course, all homeworks are treated in an individual assignment; whereas projects are considered as a group assignment. In typical, it is difficult to figure out the contributions that each member committed, the submission for these projects will be done through a git repository per group (e.g., bitbucket), and I checked all push and pull transactions to grade a team.
