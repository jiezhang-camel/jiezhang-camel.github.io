The purpose of this course is to teach the general concepts and principles behind operating systems. The topic we will cover through this class, including i) kernel and process abstractions and programming, ii) scheduling and synchronization, iii) memory management and address translation, iv) caching and virtual memory v) file systems, storage devices, files and reliability, vi) full and para-virtualization. In addition to these lectures, we will also have term projects, which use an operating system simulator/emulator built for an educational purpose. In these projects, we expect that you not only can learn Linux practices but also make great strides in studies on operating systems design and implementation. This is in C/C++, rather than Java or Python. We believe that these projects will provide a more realistic experience in operating systems to students. In this class, all homeworks are treated in an individual assignment; whereas projects are considered as a group assignment. In typical, it is difficult to figure out the contributions that each member committed, the submission for these projects will be done through a git repository per group (e.g., bitbucket), and TA will check all push and pull transactions to grade a team. Note that, in this sense, Intermediate pushes will help TA see how students are progressing. The project teams may be two persons, some may be threes; the number of students per team will be decided based on information of the final registration, and will be announced in classes.
