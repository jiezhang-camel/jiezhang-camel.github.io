For the past few decades, solid state disks (SSDs) significantly revamped their internal system architecture by employing more compute resources, multiple data channels, and tens or hundreds of non-volatile memory (NVM) packages. These ample internal resources in turn enable modern SSDs to accelerate near data processing. While the prior simulation-based work uncovered potential benefits of offloading the computation from a host to the SSDs, their analytical models make several assumptions that ignore not only detailed system parameters ranging from different micro-architectures through varying number of cores to deep memory hierarchy, but also a wide spectrum of device parameters such as emerging NVM technologies in SSDs. In this work, we propose a novel hardware/software co-design emulation platform, which not only offers flexible/scalable design space that can employ a broad range of SSD controller and firmware policies, but also capture the details of entire software/hardware stacks for SSD-accelerated near data processing. Our comprehensive evaluation results show that the near-data processing bandwidth of twenty different kernel functions we implemented can be as high as 2 GB/sec.
